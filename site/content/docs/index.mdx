GitBot is a Discord bot that let's you view information on GitHub users, repositories, pull requests, issues, etc. and has authentication using GitHub Apps to allow you to view your notifications, create repositories, merge and close pull requests, open and close issues, and view information on private repositories (of which you own)

This allows for basic GitHub functions to be executed using Discord commands once authenticated. Public information (fetched via. the GitHub API) doesn't require authentication of any kind, allowing you to view pull requests, issues, public repositories, and users.

GitBot is made using Discord.py, MongoDB, FastAPI, and the GitHub API

* **Discord.py** allows for the bot to interact and login as a Discord bot
* **MongoDB** is used for storing authentication data neccessary for usage of certain functions
* **GitHub API** is used to get GitHub information and functionality of the bot
* **FastAPI** for the API that logs your GitHub OAuth data

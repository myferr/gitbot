title: Privacy Policy for GitBot
description: The privacy policy for GitBot, please read the following document carefully.
---

**Effective Date:** July 24, 2025
**Last Updated:** July 24, 2025

GitBot ("the Bot") is a Discord bot that lets users view and interact with GitHub data directly from Discord. This Privacy Policy outlines what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

---

### 1. What We Collect

GitBot may store the following **after you explicitly authenticate via GitHub OAuth**:

* **Discord User ID:** To link your GitHub account with your Discord account.
* **GitHub Username:** To show who you are on GitHub.
* **GitHub OAuth Access Token:** To perform GitHub API requests on your behalf.

We do **not** collect your email, password, or any other sensitive account data.

---

### 2. When and How Data Is Stored

* GitHub access tokens are only saved **after you approve the GitHub app login flow**.
* If you never use `/auth` and authenticate via GitHub, we store **nothing** about you.
* We only access GitHub data (like notifications or repos) **when you request it** via a command like `/notifications` or `/repo`. Nothing is stored.

---

### 3. How We Use Your Data

Your data is used only to:

* Make authenticated API calls to GitHub (e.g., fetch notifications or list repos)
* Enable advanced features like personalized GitHub dashboards, commands, etc.

We do **not** share your data with anyone.

---

### 4. Data Storage and Security

* All user data is stored in a private MongoDB database.
* Data is only accessible by the bot and its developer.

---

### 5. Deleting Your Data

You can request deletion of your data at any time by:

* Running the `/unauth` command, or
* Contacting the developer directly via GitHub or Discord

Your GitHub token and user info will be deleted from the database.

---

### 6. Your Consent

We only store GitHub-related data **after you authorize it** through GitHub's official OAuth flow. Using the bot without logging in stores nothing about you.

---

### 7. Changes

If this policy changes, the "Last Updated" date will be changed. Major updates will be announced through the GitBot [GitHub repo](https://github.com/myferr/gitbot) or [Discord server](https://dsc.gg/myferslab).

title: Terms of Service
description: The terms of service for GitBot, please read the following document carefully.
---

**Effective Date:** July 24, 2025
**Last Updated:** July 24, 2025

By using GitBot ("the Bot"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you don’t agree, don’t use the bot.

---

### 1. What GitBot Does

GitBot is a Discord bot that helps you interact with GitHub from Discord. Features include:

* Viewing repositories and profiles
* Checking notifications
* Managing PRs and issues
* Other GitHub-related features (some require login)

---

### 2. GitHub Authentication

Some features require you to log in with GitHub.

* We only store your GitHub data **after you approve OAuth** via GitHub’s official login flow.
* Your access token is stored in plaintext in our private database.
* You can revoke access at any time by contacting the developer or using an `/unauth` command.

---

### 3. Rules

By using GitBot, you agree **not to**:

* Abuse the GitHub or Discord API (e.g. spamming commands)
* Attempt to exploit the bot or access unauthorized data
* Use the bot for anything illegal

GitBot may temporarily or permanently block users who break these rules.

We are not liable for any spamming of the GitHub API and we do not condone such activity.

---

### 4. Uptime and Data Loss

We try to keep the bot online and running, but:

* GitBot comes with **no uptime guarantee**
* We may wipe user data at any time with or without notice (though we’ll try not to)

---

### 5. Liability

GitBot is provided **“as is”**, with **no warranty** of any kind.

* We’re not responsible if you lose data, experience downtime, or GitHub/Discord APIs change.
* Use the bot at your own risk.

---

### 6. Termination

You can stop using the bot at any time. We may remove your access if:

* You violate these terms
* The bot shuts down
* GitHub/Discord revoke access

---

### 7. Changes

These terms might change. We’ll update the "Last Updated" date when we do. Continued use of the bot means you accept the new terms.
